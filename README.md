### Beginners: Generate Band Name
>This program highlights the print and input function in Python.

### Beginners: Tip Calculator
>This program involves basic mathematical calculations based on the user input.

### Beginners: Treasure Island
>This program covers the if statements (nested too) and generates a response based on the user selection.

### Beginners: Rock Paper Scissors Game
>This program introduces the random module in Python, which is used to select randomly between rock, paper or scissors.
> If statements are used to determine if the user won or loss.

### Beginners: Password Generator
>This program uses the random module to create a secured password looping over based on users choice of length and 
> shuffling the characters.

### Beginners: Hangman Game
> This is a hangman game made using ascii and nested if statements with loops. To make this game, a flow chart was 
> first created to make the algorithm.

### Beginners: Caesar Cipher
> This program encodes and decodes text message with a shift value. I was able to reuse the encode function using 
> a negative shift value which seems pretty neat.

### Beginners: Blind Auction
> This is an auction program, where use of dictionary is introduced. The max bidder is calculated by accessing stored 
> values using the key.

### Beginners: Calculator
> This program does the most basic calculation. Exposure to returning values from other function was demonstrated in this.

## Capstone Beginners: Blackjack Game
> This program is a capstone project, a blackjack game. Everything learnt in the prior challenges was applied to build 
> this. Such as random, arrays, input, if statements and loops.
